											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The goal of the <a href="http://www.utahconstitutionparty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utah Constitution Party</a>
                    is to spread the message of “Honoring God, Defending the Family, and
                    Restoring the Republic to the principles given us by the
                    Founding Fathers”. This is the same message fostered by the
                    Founding Fathers. They understood that to remain a free and
                    prosperous nation their message needed to be embedded in the
                    hearts and minds of each succeeding generation of
                    Americans.</p>
                    <p>If you're interested in participating in our party
                    proceedings and having a voice in things such as future
                    party leadership and nomination of candidates, please come
                    and join us for our county caucus and convention.</p>
                    <p>This meeting is for all members of the Utah Constitution
                    Party in Cache County no matter what precinct you are in.
                    This meeting will serve as both our caucus and our convention.</p>
                    <p>Those who are not a member of the party are also welcome to come and
                    observe. All are welcome.</p>

									<h2>State Convention</h2>

									<h2>County Executive Committee</h2>
								</header>

                <p>During our meeting, will be electing a new county executive
                committee.</p>
                <p>This committee includes the following positions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>County Chairman</li>
                  <li>County Vice Chairman</li>  
                  <li>County Secretary</li>
                  <li>County Treasurer</li>
                  <li>3 District Chairmen (North, Central, South)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ideally, we would like to fill all of these positions. At the
                very least, we need a County Chairman in order to remain an active party
                affiliate.</p>
                <p>In the past, our executive committe has done things such as
                running booths at fairs and shows, supporting other
                freedom-minded groups in the area, and supporting candidates for
                office. It can be a great way to get involved and help spread
                the message of liberty and the Constitution.</p>
                <p>The time commitment for each of these positions is
                light. It probably averages 1-2 hours a month.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in being a member of our executive
                committee, please come and join us. Feel free to contact us if you
                have any questions about these positions.</p>
